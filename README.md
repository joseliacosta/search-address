#Search Address :mag:


Welcome! It's my first project using React :atom_symbol:

I hope you enjoy this litte and modest project. If you have any questions or suggestions, please make a fork or open a issue, I will be glad to help & learn.

##How it works

**SearchAddress** is easier. I'm using two APIs to find the street and render the map component:

- [ViaCEP](https://viacep.com.br/) - To find a zip code (CEP for brazillian guys) and return some infos about address;
- [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) - To display a pin refer the address returned by zipcode, from ViaCep.

Also, to create the project and structure I'm trying [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


##How to run
